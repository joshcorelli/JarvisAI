# JarvisAI
For our capstone project we are building a Jarvis AI library that Python has to offer. This library can perform numerous tasks, such as opening websites, games, and other applications. It allows you to speak into the microphone and listens to what you ask for. What we ultimately want to accomplish is to create a GUI showcasing the abilities of this library.
